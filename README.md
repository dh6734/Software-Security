# Software-Security
Artemis Financial, a financial sector client, engaged me to address security vulnerabilities in their software, aiming to fortify their defences against potential cyber threats. My meticulous vulnerability assessment focused on critical areas such as authentication, authorization, data validation, and encryption, ensuring comprehensive protection of sensitive financial data. By identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, we bolstered Artemis Financial's security posture, safeguarding customer trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and mitigating financial risks associated with security breaches. Our approach involved implementing multi-factor authentication, strict access controls, and regular security audits, coupled with advanced security testing tools and techniques like penetration testing and static code analysis. Through thorough testing and adherence to industry best practices, we not only ensured the software's functionality but also enhanced its security, providing Artemis Financial with a robust defense against cyber threats.
